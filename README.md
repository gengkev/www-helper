I was in elementary school when writing this code, so please don't judge too hard. (Actually,
just looking at the code gives me a headache.)

Actually, the UI was pretty bad too (as well as spelling, apparently), looking at it now:

The inspiration behind this project was [The Word Within the Word](http://www.rfwp.com/series4.htm). That
program was probably actually a useful thing for me to be doing, but I was a bit annoyed at several 
repetitive aspects of the exercises.

The only real thing I ended up accomplishing was looking up definitions using the Dictionary.com developer
API, which no longer exists. I think I was planning to use [Wordnik](https://www.wordnik.com/) as well,
because I signed up for an account there. In any case, I didn't end up finishing or using this project at all. 

Now I know how to use Python and Node, so I don't have to make Chrome extensions for everything!
(Which is amusing, but I only knew how to code JS, and I had to bypass CORS.)

Here's the project summary from the Google Code page:

---

The Word within the Word Helper offers many ways to improve the efficiency of The Word within the Word,
a repetitive and mid-long-term project for 6 to 8th graders. The Word within the Word performs nothing 
more than dictionary and thesaurus lookup, and organization methods to help you do your project faster
and smarter, without guessing the answers and 
**[without cheating](https://github.com/gengkev/www-helper/wiki/Cheating)**.

The webapp will be initially be available as a packaged web app for chrome, but it may be available as 
an online web app later, however, that will be a large server load for us.
