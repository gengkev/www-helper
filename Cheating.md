# Introduction #

We realize that many people will be thinking about the question, "Is using this app cheating?" Our opinion is no, unless you abuse it.

This application does not use Artificial Intelligence to replicate the brain and automatically generate answers. It only does what you are already permitted to do using the computer, such as look up items in the dictionary, and type up your answers, but in an automated fashion. For us, it would be too hard to program past the limit (AI,) but be careful not to use this in ways you are not supposed to, as in a question where looking up answers in the dictionary is forbidden. We can't prevent that from happening.

Using this app is equivalent to having a math worksheet where you can use a calculator on the computer, but using a smart calculator like [Wolfram|Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/). There shouldn't be anything wrong with stretching the rules to the limit, as long as you don't do anything with this application that you can already do using less sophisticated methods on the computer.
